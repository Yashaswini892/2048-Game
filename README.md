2048 is a very popular single-player game for Web and mobile. It’s a type of “sliding block puzzle” — think Threes!, on which 2048 is based, or the old-timey game klotski — that’s played on an almost Sudoku-like grid. Like Sudoku, it also involves some math. The object of the game is to combine the numbers displayed on the tiles until you reach 2048.

### How to play -

Use the arrow buttons present on the screen to make moves respective to their pointing direction. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. Continue the game until all the tiles are filled and no other move is poosible in any of the directions.

### Rules of this Game -

Basically, 2048 presents with with a 4×4 grid. When you start the game, there will be two “tiles” on the grid, each displaying the number 2 or 4. You hit the arrows on the screen to make a move — and also to generate new tiles, which will also be valued at 2 or 4. When two equal tiles collide, they combine to give you one greater tile that displays their sum. The more you do this, obviously, the higher the tiles get and the more crowded the board becomes. Your objective is to reach 2048 before the board fills up, else you lose the game.
